# Message Booth
“Message Booth” is a model of 8 cities which share a direct or an indirect path for the network connection. The model, designed, initially checks if there exists a direct path between the two cities for the message transmission. If there exists a direct path, the message can be transmitted directly; otherwise this model finds the most suitable and shortest path between the two cities of the model. The shortest path between the current city and the destination city  is displayed to the sender and thereby he is requested to type his message. If the sender is interested in sending the message through the provided path, he shall continue and type his message, if not he can terminate the process. If the sender does not terminate the process, the model asks for the desired message the sender wants to send to the destination city. The message shall be encrypted at the very instant the sender completes writing his message, using the symmetric key technique. The secret key is shared between the sender and the receiver. The sender’s copy of the key helps in the encryption of the message and the receiver’s copy of the key helps in the decryption. Once the message is received, the receiver sends the acknowledgement that the message has successfully been received.  

Below is the pictorial representation of the model.The 8 cities have been assigned code digits to make the communication easier in this model.
